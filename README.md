# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This repository is made for the display of my final semester graduate Capstone project.

1. Inspiration

With the growth of the e-commerce industry and community and the dire to make the global economy cashless, there have been people choosing digital payments over cash. Fraud is a huge national and worldwide problem; we will see credit card fraud rise at rates faster than ever. Credit card fraud is a form of identity theft involving criminal deception for personal financial gain. Here are some quick stats about credit card frauds:

*	There were 650,572 cases of identity theft in the U.S. in 2019. Of those, 41 percent, or just over 270,000, were credit card fraud
* In 2018, $24.26 Billion was lost due to payment card fraud worldwide
* Credit card fraud was ranked #1 type of Identity theft fraud
* The United States leads as the most credit fraud-prone country with 38.6% of reported card fraud losses in 2018

To identify the factors leading to scams and minimize their extent, I decided to build a project that recognizes whether the transaction is a fraud or genuine.
